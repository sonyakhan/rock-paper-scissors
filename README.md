# rock-paper-scissors

## CLI implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors modeled on [these guidelines](https://gist.github.com/Trevoke/5d5eb359d91790650195).

### Warmup: Why are the stories broken down in this way?

The user stories are ordered in increasing levels of complexity, with each layer focused on sharpening a different set of software engineering skills and principles.

#### Part 1
Build bare bones functionality with emphasis on testing, TDD, and forming great commit messages, which will lay the groundwork for the rest of the parts.

#### Part 2
Learn chip away at a single file and refactor it into multiple logically sensible files, and to integrate existing code into an alternative format that’s unfamiliar.

#### Part 3
Use existing code to introduce layers of increasingly more complex features and learn to work with unfamiliar business logic.

#### Part 4
Gain the ability to do everything in Part 1 + refactor existing code into a new, unfamiliar framework, while utilizing the same set of software engineering concepts.

#### Part 5
Understand *why* we have tests: to break them, write new ones that reflect the current state of the world, alter core business logic, and make the tests pass again.

#### Part 6
Test the limits of a “persistence layer” of the application via `.yml` file in order to understand the pain points for the future, when we would actually want to implement data models and have a DB persist the data.

#### Part 7
After experiencing pain points of inefficiency, learn to structure the data modeling portion of the application.
